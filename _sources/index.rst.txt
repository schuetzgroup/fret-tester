Documentation of the `fret-tester` python package
=================================================

This is a software implementation of the smFRET kinetics analysis method
described in the Journal of Chemical Physics article “Kinetic analysis of
single molecule FRET transitions without trajectories” [1]_, which
was used to perform the data anlysis for the article.

The source code including an extensive tutorial can be found on
`github <https://github.com/schuetzgroup/fret-tester>`_.
