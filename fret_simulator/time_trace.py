def two_state_truth(life_times, efficiencies, duration):
    """Simulate ground truth smFRET time trace for a two state system

    Assume that the states' life times are exponentially distributed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    life_times : array_like, shape=(2,)
        Mean (of the exponentially distributed) life times of the states
    efficiencies : array_like, shape=(2,)
        FRET efficiencies for the states
    duration : float
        Minimum duration of the time trace. In practice, it will be a little
        longer unless a state change occurs incidentally exactly at the
        specified time, for which the probability is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    time : numpy.ndarray
        Time points of state changes. These are bi-exponentially distributed.
    eff : numpy.ndarray
        Corresponding FRET efficiencies. The `i`-th entry lasts from
        ``time[i-1]`` (or 0 for i=0) to ``time[i]``.
